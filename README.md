# Anansi
A python 2.7 library to generate and post process elastomer networks.
It use Networkx, numpy and scipy libraries.
The data and dump files that can be converted are from Lammps (a molecular dynamics software by Sandia labs).
This library have been created during my PhD in Mat√©is lab.

At this moment, only the crosslink_particularities and the file_conversion files are fully cleaned and functionnal.
The older version of the library (initially named graph, because it use, well..., graphs) can be found in the older_version folder. 
This older version is fully fonctionnal, albeit a bit lacking in docstring and half-written in French.
